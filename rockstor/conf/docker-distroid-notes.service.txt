Files with a name pattern of: docker-distroid.service

where distroid = distro.id()

are currently hand copied from their distro docker package origin, usually:
/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

src/rockstor/smart_manager/views/docker_service.py then stream edits them.

See docker_service.py for pre-instantiation edit details.

Auto edit is performed on Docker service enable event within Web-UI and
attempts to honour all existing dockerd arguments.
